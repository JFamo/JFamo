# About Me

I am a full stack software developer who has both led and worked on Agile development teams. I earned my Master's in Computer Science at the Pennsylvania State University.

### Stuff from Penn State

* I worked with a team to develop a [simulation](https://youtu.be/0fcY2BvbY5o) of airport queueing delay to experiment with policy changes for data sharing and demand forecasting in C#, which placed 2nd in the [Airport Cooperative Research Program Design Challenge](https://vsgc.odu.edu/acrpdesigncompetition/auto-draft/)
* Natural Language Processing and Optical Character Recognition of high school student transcripts for the Nittany AI Alliance
* Developing a bootloader and kernel in C & Assembly for a Special Topics - Operating Systems course
* Training a Transformer to predict branch coverage given some input seed for fuzzing
* Implementing a cross-platform object detection suite using YOLO models for Augmentative and Alternative Communication uses
* Optimizing machine learning model architectures for abnormal behavior detection in public areas

### Other Cool Stuff

* I just finished drafting a [daily rundown tool](https://github.com/JFamo/PsuToday) interacting with APIs from Penn State, OpenWeatherAPI, and Canvas
* Check out my genetic algorithm that plays Tetris [here](https://jfamo.github.io/javascript-tetris/)
